                        The iPhone 5C lacks several major new features
                        introduced in the iPhone 5S; the 5C uses the A6
                        chip instead of the A7 with motion co-processor,
                        does not include Touch ID, does not support OpenGL
                        ES 3.0, and lacked the Burst iSight camera mode and
                        slow-motion video recording mode. Instead, the iPhone 5C
                        uses much of the same internal hardware of its predecessor,
                        the iPhoneÂ 5. However the iPhone 5C uses a hard-coated
                        polycarbonate casing
                        (eschewing the aluminum used by the iPhone 5),
                        along with a standard black glass front
                        (instead of a white glass
                        front offered on silver and gold iPhone models).
                        Similar to the
                        fifth generation iPod Touch models, the iPhone 5C
                        was available
                        in five colors: blue, green, pink, yellow, and white.
                        It was also
                        the first Apple device to ship with iOS 7,
                        which introduced a revamped
                        visual appearance and other new features.
                        It is also the last iPhone
                        to include the familiar "squircle" icon on the Home button.
